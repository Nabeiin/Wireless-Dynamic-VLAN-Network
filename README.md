# Wireless-Dynamic-VLAN-Network
A Packet Tracer simulation of Dynamic VLAN assignment in a secure wireless network using Cisco devices.
# Dynamic VLAN in Wireless Network (Cisco Packet Tracer Simulation)

This project simulates a dynamic VLAN assignment system in a secure enterprise wireless network using Cisco Packet Tracer.

## 📌 Project Objective

To demonstrate the configuration and simulation of:

- VLAN segmentation for **Management, Students, Faculty, and Guests**
- **Dynamic IP assignment** using a centralized DHCP server
- **RADIUS-based user authentication** with SSH access
- **Firewall rules**, inter-VLAN routing, and DHCP relays
- **Secure wireless access** using Cisco WLC and Access Points

## 🧱 Network Components

- Cisco Multilayer Switch (3560)
- Cisco Access Switches (2960)
- Cisco Wireless LAN Controller (WLC)
- Cisco Access Points (AP)
- DHCP Server
- RADIUS Server
- Cisco ASA Firewall
- ISP Router and Core Router






## ⚙️ Key Features

- 🔐 RADIUS-based authentication for SSH login
- 📡 Wireless access for students, faculty, and guests via VLAN assignment
- 🛡️ Firewall rules to secure internal and external communication
- 🌐 NAT and static routing between internal network and ISP
- 📥 DHCP relay with IP helper for remote DHCP assignment


## 🛠️ How to Open the Project

1. Open Cisco Packet Tracer
2. Load pkt file
3. Explore configurations by entering CLI on each device
4. Refer to documentation for step-by-step details
